# Project Documentation: Conversational Chatbot and PDF Sharing Platform

## Overview
This project aims to develop a conversational chatbot with the ability to process voice commands and text input and provide responses in both text and speech formats. The chatbot utilizes advanced LLM and AI techniques and can generate a customized story-telling book with AI-generated images based on user prompts. The project also includes a PDF-sharing platform that allows users to browse, search, view, and download PDF documents without relying on a Content Delivery Network (CDN).

1. Conversational Chatbot:
   - Accepts voice commands and text input from users.
   - Responds to both text and speech formats.
   - Supports prompt input from files, images, and cameras.
   - Generates a storytelling book with AI-generated images based on the provided prompt.

2. PDF Sharing Platform:
   - Allows users to browse, search, view, and download PDF documents.
   - Provides efficient searching using titles or keywords.
   - Does not rely on a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for PDF storage.
